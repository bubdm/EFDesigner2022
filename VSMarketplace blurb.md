<h1>For Visual Studio 2022</h1>

This Visual Studio 2022 extension is the easiest way to add a consistently correct Entity Framework model to your project with support for EF6 and EFCore2-6.

It's an opinionated code generator, adding a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most importantly, **visual** design of persistent classes. 
Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to 
explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

While giving you complete control over how the code is generated you'll be able to create, out of the box, sophisticated, consistent and **correct** Entity Framework code 
that can be regenerated when your model changes. And, since the code is written using partial classes, any additions you make to your generated code are retained across 
subsequent generations. The designer doesn't need to be present to use the code that's generated - it generates standard C#, using the code-first, fluent API - so the 
tool doesn't become a dependency to your project.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home. The goal was to duplicate at least those features and, in addition, 
add all the little things that _should_ have been there. Things like:

*   importing entities from C# source, or existing DbContext definitions (including their entities) from compiled EF6 or EFCore assemblies
*   multiple views of your model to highlight important aspects of your design
*   the ability to show and hide parts of the model
*   easy customization of generated output by editing or even replacing the T4 templates
*   entities by default generated as partial classes so the generated code can be easily extended
*   class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
*   different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
*   string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer

and many other nice-to-have bits.

**Note:** This tool does not reverse engineer from the database (i.e., "database-first"). Microsoft has provided tools for that, and there are other, well-maintained opensourced 
projects that provide that functionality as well.

**Migrating from VS2019**
You'll have to change a line in your model's <modelname>.tt file to accommodate how Visual Studio 2022 handles library imports in text templates.

Change line 5, which reads
```
#><#@ assembly name="EnvDTE"
```
to be
```
#><#@ assembly name="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Interop"

```
That's it. Of course, if you customized any of the standard templates, you'll have to go through the customizations the same way you've always done and 
bump your changes up against the new templates. Not much has changed that didn't absolutely _need_ to be changed due to the VS2022 differences, but there
may be a bugfix or two your customized templates don't have. But, hey ... if you've been customizing the templates, you know the drill, right?
